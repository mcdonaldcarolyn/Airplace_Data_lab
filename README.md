###Module2 Introduction to Data Science Lab
This is a Deep Analysis of Airplane model, both small and large, using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas


## Discussion conclusion

From the Data that was used in the previous graphs and using injury rate over destruction rate, 
the recommendation for Small planes are:
    1. Maule- 0.16 injury Rate(the lowest) and a very low destruction rate, 0.04
    2. Aviat Aircraft Inc — low injury rate (0.17), low destruction rate (0.04)
    3. Grumman/Schweizer — low injury rate (0.21), lowest destruction rate (0.02)
    4. Stinson — moderate injury rate (0.22), very low destruction rate (0.02)
    5. Bellanca — low injury rate (0.22), low destruction rate (0.05)

For Large Planes:
    1. Mcdonnell Douglas- 0.008 Injury Rate, and a moderate destruction rate, 0.11
    2. Boeing — low injury rate (0.10), lowest destruction rate (0.10), most data points (283 accidents)
    3. Embraer — low injury rate (0.10), low destruction rate (0.09)
    4. Airbus — slightly higher but still reasonable (0.18 injury, 0.17 destruction)
